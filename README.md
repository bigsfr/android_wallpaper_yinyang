Introduction
============

Project for generating Yin Yang -symbol as an Android Livepaper, making it dynamical
OpenGL ES 2.0 shaders for rendering it on screen. There are some somewhat 'ugliesh'
hacks involved, e.g renderer is implemented directly into GLSurfaceView, which
isn't the best option if similarly named methods are introduced to base class
one day.

Beyond this, screensaver should comply with regular expectations one could have for
them. Application icon and screensaver thumbnail image are the same ones for
size reasons. While making rendering as dynamic as possible - it comes along
with the good news as file size tends to drop significantly.

That said, hope you enjoy this tiny Yin Yang live wallpaper for Android devices.
